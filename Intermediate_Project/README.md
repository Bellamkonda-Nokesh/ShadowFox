# Delhi AQI Analysis – Decision-Oriented Study

## Objective
This project analyzes Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) to identify
high-risk pollution periods, key contributing pollutants, and seasonal
patterns that impact public health.

Rather than only visualizing AQI values, this study focuses on
transforming AQI data into actionable insights for policy planning
and health awareness.
