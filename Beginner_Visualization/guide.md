# Visualization as a Decision-Making Tool
## Matplotlib vs Plotly

### 1. Why Visualization Matters
Visualization is not just about plotting data. It is about transforming raw numbers
into insights that support decision-making in business, research, and public policy.
This guide focuses on choosing the *right visualization* for the *right decision*.

### 2. Library Overview

#### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a low-level visualization library primarily used for static,
publication-quality plots. It is widely used in research, academic reports,
and situations where precision and reproducibility matter more than interactivity.

**Best suited for:**
- Research papers
- Reports and PDFs
- Controlled visual outputs

---

#### Plotly
Plotly is a high-level interactive visualization library that allows users
to explore data dynamically. It is widely used in dashboards and presentations
where user interaction adds value.

**Best suited for:**
- Dashboards
- Exploratory analysis
- Stakeholder presentations

### 3. Visualization Types & Decision Use-Cases

| Chart Type | Decision Question Answered |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Line Plot | Is performance improving or declining over time? |
| Bar Chart | Which category contributes the most? |
| Scatter Plot | Are two variables related? |
| Histogram | Is the data skewed or normally distributed? |
| Heatmap | Where are the problem hotspots? |

---

### 4. Why Context Matters More Than Charts
The same dataset can tell different stories depending on how it is visualized.
Choosing the wrong chart can hide trends, exaggerate patterns, or mislead decisions.

### 5. Matplotlib vs Plotly: Decision-Based Comparison

| Criteria | Matplotlib | Plotly |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Ease of Use | Easy | Medium |
| Customization | High | High |
| Interactivity | Low | Very High |
| Performance | High | Moderate |
| Best Use Case | Reports & Research | Dashboards & Exploration |

### 6. Key Takeaway
Visualization should be selected based on *who* is consuming the insight and *what decision*
needs to be made, not just on aesthetic preference.
